# GitHub Pull Request Cherry-Pick CLI

A CLI utility written in Go that allows you to cherry-pick entire GitHub pull requests to a destination branch. GitHub doesn't have this functionality ready-to-use, so this project solves that problem by automating the cherry-pick process while preserving the original PR's metadata.

## Prerequisites

- Go (for building the utility)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - must be pre-configured and authenticated
- Git repository with proper access permissions

## Usage

```bash
gh-cp <pull-request-number> <target-branch> [--dry-run]
```

**Parameters:**
- `pull-request-number` - The number of the merged pull request to cherry-pick
- `target-branch` - The destination branch to cherry-pick the changes to (also becomes the base branch for the new PR)
- `--dry-run` - (Optional) Preview mode: shows what would be done without making any remote changes

**Examples:**
```bash
# Cherry-pick PR #1319 to release/v2.1 branch
gh-cp 1319 release/v2.1

# Preview the cherry-pick operation without making changes
gh-cp 1319 release/v2.1 --dry-run
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetches PR Information**: Uses `gh pr view 1319 --json "number,title,body,state,baseRefName,mergeCommit,commits,labels"` to retrieve all information about the pull request

2. **Validates PR State**: Ensures the PR is merged (cherry-picking unmerged changes is not supported)

3. **Creates New Branch**: Checks out to the target branch and creates a new branch with the naming pattern `cherry-pick-to/target-branch/from/original-branch`

4. **Cherry-picks Changes**: Applies all commits from the original PR to the new branch

5. **Creates New PR**: Pushes changes and creates a new pull request targeting the specified branch with:
   - Title prefixed with `[cherry-pick]`
   - Body prefixed with a reference message linking to the original PR
   - All original labels copied over
   - Same description as the original PR
   - Base branch set to the target branch you specified

## Current Limitations

- **Conflict Resolution**: The tool does not automatically resolve merge conflicts. If conflicts occur during cherry-picking, the process will stop and require manual intervention
- **Merged PRs Only**: Only works with merged pull requests

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Cherry-pick PR #1319 to the release/v2.1 branch
gh-cp 1319 release/v2.1
```

This will:
1. Fetch information about PR #1319
2. Create a new branch `cherry-pick-to/release-v2.1/from/feature-branch-name` based on `release/v2.1`
3. Cherry-pick all commits from PR #1319
4. Push the new branch (with force to handle conflicts)
5. Create a new PR from `cherry-pick-to/release-v2.1/from/feature-branch-name` ‚Üí `release/v2.1` titled `[cherry-pick] Original PR Title` with a link back to PR #1319

## Dry-Run Mode

Use `--dry-run` to preview operations without making any remote changes:

```bash
gh-cp 1319 release/v2.1 --dry-run
```

In dry-run mode, the tool will:
- ‚úÖ Fetch PR information and validate it's merged
- ‚úÖ Create local branch and cherry-pick commits
- üîç Show push command that would be executed
- üîç Show PR creation command that would be executed
- ‚úÖ Clean up local branch and return to original state
